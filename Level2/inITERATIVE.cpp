Inorder Tree Traversal without Recursion
Using Stack is the obvious way to traverse tree without recursion. Below is an algorithm for 
traversing binary tree using stack. See this for step wise step execution of the algorithm.

1) Create an empty stack S.
2) Initialize current node as root
3) Push the current node to S and set current = current->left until current is NULL
4) If current is NULL and stack is not empty then 
     a) Pop the top item from stack.
     b) Print the popped item, set current = popped_item->right 
     c) Go to step 3.
5) If current is NULL and stack is empty then we are done.
Let us consider the below tree for example

            1
          /   \
        2      3
      /  \
    4     5

Step 1 Creates an empty stack: S = NULL

Step 2 sets current as address of root: current -> 1

Step 3 Pushes the current node and set current = current->left until current is NULL
     current -> 1
     push 1: Stack S -> 1
     current -> 2
     push 2: Stack S -> 2, 1
     current -> 4
     push 4: Stack S -> 4, 2, 1
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 4: Stack S -> 2, 1
     b) print "4"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 4  and go to step 3
Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything. 

Step 4 pops again.
     a) Pop 2: Stack S -> 1
     b) print "2"
     c) current -> 5/*right of 2 and go to step 3

Step 3 pushes 5 to stack and makes current NULL
     Stack S -> 5, 1
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 5: Stack S -> 1
     b) print "5"
     c) current = NULL right of 5  and go to step 3
Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything

Step 4 pops again.
     a) Pop 1: Stack S -> NULL
     b) print "1"
     c) current -> 3 right of 5  

Step 3 pushes 3 to stack and makes current NULL
     Stack S -> 3
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 3: Stack S -> NULL
     b) print "3"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 3   

Traversal is done now as stack S is empty and current is NULL.

/*
Inorder Tree Traversal without recursion and without stack!
Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion.
 The idea of Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary Tree. In this traversal, 
 we first create links to Inorder successor and print the data using these links, and finally revert
 the changes to restore original tree.

1. Initialize current as root 
2. While current is not NULL
   If current does not have left child
      a) Print current’s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   Else
      a) Make current as right child of the rightmost 
         node in current's left subtree
      b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
Although the tree is modified through the traversal, it is reverted back to its original shape
 after the completion. Unlike Stack based traversal, no extra space is required for this traversal.
