K distance from root (Function Program)
Given a Binary Tree and a number k. Print all nodes that are at distance k from root
 (root is considered at distance 0 from itself).  Nodes should be printed from left to right. 
 If k is more that height of tree, nothing should be printed.

For example, if below is given tree and k is 2.  Output should be 4 5 6.

Count BST nodes that lie in a given range (Function Program)
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a range, count the number of nodes in the BST that lie in the given range.
 You are required to complete the function getCountOfNode. You should not read any input from stdin/console.
 There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.
