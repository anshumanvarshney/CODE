0-1 Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of cap acity W to get the maximum 
total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] 
which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W
 which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of 
 the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
0-1 means  You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
