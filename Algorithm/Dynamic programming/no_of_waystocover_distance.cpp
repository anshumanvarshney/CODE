Count number of ways to cover a distance
Given a distance â€˜dist, count total number of ways to cover the distance with 1, 2 and 3 steps.

Examples:

Input:  n = 3
Output: 4
Below are the four ways
 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
 1 step + 2 step
 2 step + 1 step
 3 step

 
 
Input:  n = 4
1111
121
211
112
31
13
22
Output: 7

Algo :

The time complexity of above solution is exponential, a close upper bound is O(3n). 
If we draw the complete recursion tree, we can observer that many subproblems are solved again and again.
 For example, when we start from n = 6, we can reach 4 by subtracting one 2 times and by subtracting 2 one times.
 So the subproblem for 4 is called twice.
Since same suproblems are called again, this problem has Overlapping Subproblems property.
 So min square sum problem has both properties (see this and this) of a dynamic programming problem. 
 Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, 
recomputations of same subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array count[] in bottom up manner.

Generalization of the above problem
How to count number of ways if the person can climb up to m stairs for a given value m? For example if m is 4, the person can climb 1 stair or 2 stairs or 3 stairs or 4 stairs at a time.

We can write the recurrence as following.

   ways(n, m) = ways(n-1, m) + ways(n-2, m) + ... ways(n-m, m)
