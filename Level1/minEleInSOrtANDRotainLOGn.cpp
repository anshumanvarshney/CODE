Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array in logn time
A sorted array is rotated at some unknown point, find the minimum element in it.

Following solution assumes that all elements are distinct.

Examples

Input: {5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1

Input: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1

Input: {2, 1}
Output: 1

my method
if(a[0]<a[1]) a[0] si minimum
else traverse until you get a[i]>a[i+1] then a[i+1] is minimum 
eg 5 6 1 2 3 4 
6>1 so 1 is minimum

Method 2:

When you split the sorted, rotated array into two halves (arr[1],..,arr[mid]) and (arr[mid+1],..,arr[n]),
 one of them is always sorted and the other always has the min. We can directly use a modified binary search 
 to keep searching in the unsorted half

// index of first element
l = 0

// index of last element.
h = arr.length - 1

// always restrict the search to the unsorted 
// sub-array. The min is always there.
while (arr[l] > arr[h]) {
        // find mid.
        mid = (l + h)/2
        // decide which sub-array to continue with.
        if (arr[mid] > arr[h]) {
                l = mid + 1
        } else {
                h = mid
        }
}
// answer
return arr[l]




A simple solution is to traverse the complete array and find minimum. This solution requires Î˜(n) time.
We can do it in O(Logn) using Binary Search. If we take a closer look at above examples,
 we can easily figure out following pattern:

Method 1:

You can do this in O(logN) time.

Use a modified binary search to find the point of rotation which is an index i such that
arr[i] > arr[i+1].

Example:

[6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5]
       ^
       i
The two sub-arrays 
(arr[1], arr[2], .., arr[i]) and
(arr[i+1], arr[i+2], ..., arr[n]) are sorted.

The answer is  min(arr[1], arr[i+1])
